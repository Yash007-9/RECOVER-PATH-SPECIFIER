# RECOVER-PATH-SPECIFIER
I was given a task to decode GPS data from a u-blox GNSS module, plan a path on a predefined gridmap from a start to a goal position, and generate odometry commands for a rover. The project was divided into four main tasks: decoding GPS data, implementing a path planning algorithm, generating odometry commands, and compiling/running the code. I understood that the goal was to extract latitude and longitude from the UBX format, use a grid-based algorithm (like A*) to plan an optimal path, and then convert that path into movement commands. However, I got stuck during compilation and couldn’t successfully run the code using make build or make check. I believe the issue might be in the ublox_reader.cpp or planning.cpp files, possibly due to logic errors or incomplete functions. I tried to follow the structure, but without successful compilation, I couldn’t verify if my logic was correct.
